#  Eye Tracker 

This project collects gaze point information from the Tobii Gaming eye tracker. It presents images and records the data stream to a JSON file. 

The resulting data can be visualizaed by the [output program](https://github.com/cbroms/of-eye-tracker-output), which creates a sequence of images created from cropping around the area of the image fixated on. 

Built with openFrameworks.
